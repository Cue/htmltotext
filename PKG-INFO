Description: 
        The htmltotext module
        =====================
        
        This package was written for a search engine, to allow it to extract the
        textual content and metadata from HTML pages.  It tries to cope with
        invalid markup and incorrectly specified character sets, and strips out
        HTML tags (splitting words at tags appropriately).  It also discards the
        contents of script tags and style tags.
        
        As well as text from the body of the page, it extracts the page title,
        and the content of meta description and keyword tags.  It also parses
        meta robots tags to determine whether the page should be indexed.
        
        The HTML parser used by this module was extracted from the Xapian search
        engine library (and specifically, from the omindex indexing utility in
        that library).
